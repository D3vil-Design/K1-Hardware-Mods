# K1 5015 Bed Fans

![20231012_155943](https://github.com/D3vil-Design/K1-Hardware-Mods/assets/145330457/fd37e89d-60dc-441f-81ba-99080f510d08)


## INTRODUCTION
I made this mod to help with heating the enclosure. It uses one or two 5015 24V blowers. I have the fans wired in parallel using the exhaust fan port since I don't use it (up to you). These bed fans were tested using an AC bed (110V, 500W). Chamber temps reached 60°c in just under 5 minutes and sabilized at 70°c in 10 minutes. The bed fans can work with the factory bed/bed heater but it won't be as effective.
