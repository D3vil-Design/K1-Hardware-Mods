# D3D K1 Hardware Modifications

This repository is dedicated to providing a centralized location to the hardware modifications that the D3vil Design team has created for the Creality K1 and K1 Max.

If you would like to support the team to fund future projects, you can visit us at our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/D3vilDesign). We will begin posting behind the scenes projects, beta access to projects in flight, and more exclusively for our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/D3vilDesign) supporters. If you're interested in more K1 work (and some "top secret" work outside of the K1 😉), please consider [supporting the team](https://www.patreon.com/D3vilDesign). All funds go directly to the development and support of the D3vil Design team!

A tutorial for some of the WIP things here can be found at one of our D3vil Design team member's YouTube channel, Omranello: https://www.youtube.com/@omranello. Otherwise, **please refer to the respective README in each mod's folder.**
